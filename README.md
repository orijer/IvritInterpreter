# Ivrit Programming Language Interpreter

Welcome to Ivrit, a simple Hebrew Programming Language, that I created! 
This repository hosts the official Ivrit Interpreter, made in Java, and a thorough tutorial on the syntax and structure of Ivrit.

You can choose to either use the already compiled version packaged in a convenient executable, or download the java source files directly.

## Features
* **A complete experience in Hebrew: From the programming to the execution**
* **Easy to learn: Designed as a great entry point for people with no prior programming experience**
* **Simple: Very easy and quick to start a new Ivrit project**
* **Implemented in Java: Great for all Operating Systems**
* **Open sourced: Anyone can download, read and rewrite any part from the interpreter**
