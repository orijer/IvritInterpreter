# Ivrit Programming Language Interpreter

Welcome to Ivrit, a simple Hebrew Programming Language, that I created! 
This repository hosts the official Ivrit Interpreter, made in Java, together with a backend server that can run it using SPRING.

You can choose to either use the already compiled version packaged in a convenient executable, or download the java source files directly.


## Features
* **A complete experience in Hebrew: From the programming to the execution**
* **Easy to learn: Designed as a great entry point for people with no prior programming experience**
* **Simple: Very easy and quick to start a new Ivrit project**
* **Implemented in Java: Great for all Operating Systems**
* **Open sourced: Anyone can download, read and rewrite any part from the interpreter**
* **Server ready: Comes with a backend program built in using SPRING that allows one computer to run Ivrit code from many users**


## Getting Started

The first step is to download the Ivrit Interpreter executable in the [releases section](https://github.com/orijer/IvritInterpreter/releases).
Read the install instructions carefully.

The Ivrit Interpreter executable is a GUI program that I made, that allows the user to enter a path to a txt file that contains Ivrit code (more on that later)
and follows the code until completion. We use it to run the Ivrit code files we create.

The second step is to learn the Ivrit language syntax and strcture. You can find a full tutorial (In Hebrew) [here](https://ivrit-lang.vercel.app/tutorial). This website also contains a live-editor in which you can write and run Ivrit code directly on the browser without downloading anything else. This tutorial will teach you everything you need to know about the Ivrit language.

Any questions regarding the Ivrit programming language itself should be asked in the [Ivrit Language Questions](https://github.com/orijer/IvritInterpreter/discussions/categories/ivrit-language-questions) in the discussions segment.


## Tests
In the repository we have a tests folder which includes 2 text file: testCode, testResult.

You can run the interpreter on testCode and compare the output to testResult.

Tip: testCode is completely in Ivrit, which means that it is also worth reading to see more examples if needed.
