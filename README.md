# Ivrit Programming Language Interpreter

Welcome to Ivrit, a simple Hebrew Programming Language I created! 
This repository hosts the official Ivrit Interpreter, made in Java, and a thorough tutorial on the syntax of Ivrit.
You can choose to either use the already compiled version packaged in a convenient executable, or download the java source files directly.
